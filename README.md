# saj_richpresence
saj_richpresence is a script designed for ESX versions up to 1.7.5 that integrates with Discord to provide custom rich presence information for online players.

## Features:
- Custom Discord Rich Presence: Once configured and running, this script displays a custom rich presence for each online player, including their in-game name and player ID.
Dynamic Data Retrieval: The script retrieves the player's first and last name from the database. During the initial connection, there may be a brief delay while the playerâ€™s name is loading.

## Configuration:
- Edit config.lua: Enter your Discord app ID and icon ID in the configuration file to set up the rich presence display.
